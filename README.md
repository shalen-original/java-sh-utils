# SHUtils - Shalen Utilites #

This is a simple library I created for my university assignments. It contains a list of useful Java functions, to use when needed.

## Modules ##

### shutils.array ###
Handles basic array stuff such as swap and random array generation. It also implements some methods already present in the standard library (such as *clone*), because we were not allowed to use them.

### shtutils.profile ###
Contains a basic method profiler.

### shutils.data.structures (coming soon)###
Contains all the implementation of data structures shown and implemented in the course. These are the common
structures taught in every *Introduction to Algorithm* course.

### shutils.data.visualization ###
Contains all the utilities that can be used to visualize data. Examples are:

* CSV to Latex table converter
* CSV to Matlab data set

## Tests ##
The test folder contains all the JUnit test used to test if the implementation of the methods are correct. They are not the best of the world, but they will do.

## How to setup the environment##
In order to start working on the library you should:

* Clone this repository
* Open Eclipse -> File -> Import -> Existing Projects into Workspace
* You can start working
