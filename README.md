# SHUtils - Shalen Utilites #

This is a simple library I created for my university assignments. It contains a list of useful Java functions, to use when needed.

## Modules ##

### shutils.array ###
Handles basic array stuff such as swap and random array generation. It also implements some methods already present in the standard library (such as *clone*), because we were not allowed to use them.

### shtutils.profile ###
Contains a basic method profiler and some tools for data visualization.
